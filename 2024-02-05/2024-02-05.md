## Daily notes
I decided to stream through the night in order to reset my sleep schedule. During this stream I plan to:
- [x] create a daily schedule for the next 5 weeks to try out and see how it goes.
- [ ] create one article, video, infographic and associated shorts, codepens, graphics etc. for WCAG 101
- [ ] do some client work (PP and CP)
- [ ] decide what else I want to build over the next few weeks and nail down streaming daily activities so I can release the schedule.

## Completed tasks
- Completed a daily schedule and list of items to do each day. (see screenshot)
- created the building in public repository
- started working on WCAG101 first article.

## Content created:
none completed so far, working on the WCAG101 article.

## Random 
Pomodoros seem to be working, but I do need to find a way to chat to people during breaks and take a break as well, so I should take a break 5 minutes before or after the actual break timer for me and then chat to everyone else.
