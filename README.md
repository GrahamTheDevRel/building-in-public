# building a business in public
So I decided to build a business, and I decided to make it **very** public.

You see, a lot of the time you hear from people who have already "made it". And the problem with that is that they then give advice based on where they are *after* success, adding a few "struggles" into their story. 

But this loses a lot of the actual pain points of starting a business. 

On top of that, most people say "I bootstrapped my business" and then you find out they had a 6 figure job and plenty of savings.

I do not have either of those things. 

All I have is some experience (I ran a business before) and an idea.

So I thought I would share everything, "warts and all", as I try to take a business from zero to hero. 

If that interests you, then give this repo a star and check back regularly, so you can see a diary / public record (most days) and summaries of important lessons, thoughts, milestones and more as and when they happen.
